# mail
Creating an email using python.

This code sends an email with an HTML body and an image attachment using the SMTP protocol. It uses the smtplib library to establish a secure connection with the SMTP server and the MIMEText and MIMEMultipart classes from the email.mime.text and email.mime.multipart modules to construct the email message.

# Usage
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

The smtplib module is usually included in Python's standard library, so you should already have it.
The email module is also part of the standard library and provides the required classes for creating and sending emails.
Replace the placeholder values with your own email information:

sender_email: Replace "supraja2d@gmail.com" with your own email address.
receiver_email: Replace "snehalathanandikolamath@gmail.com" with the recipient's email address.
subject: Replace "Subject of the email" with the desired subject line of your email.
image_url: Replace "https://images.pexels.com/photos/96627/pexels-photo-96627.jpeg?cs=srgb&dl=pexels-photomix-company-96627.jpg&fm=jpg" with the URL of the image you want to include in the email.
username: Replace "supraja2d@gmail.com" with your email address.
password: Replace "tofluxdemjigaprs" with your email account password or an application-specific password.
Set the correct SMTP server and port:

By default, the code is set to use Gmail's SMTP server (smtp.gmail.com) on port 465, which uses SSL encryption. If you are using a different email provider, you may need to update these values accordingly.
(Optional) Enable debug mode:

If you want to see the communication between the script and the SMTP server for debugging purposes, uncomment the line context.set_debuglevel(1) by removing the leading # character.
Run the code:

Execute the script, and it will send the email with the specified HTML content and image attachment to the recipient's email address.
Note: Make sure you have a stable internet connection and that your email provider allows SMTP access.
